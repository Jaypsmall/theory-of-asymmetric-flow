# 📌 Overview

**La Pekillada** is the first reference implementation of the **Asymmetric Flow & Geometric Absorption Algorithm**, developed to study the behavior of the **Theory of Asymmetric Flow** through computational simulation.

Created and documented by:

**@Jaypsmall**

Project name:

**La Pekillada**

# 🧠 Theoretical Foundation

This repository is based on the **Theory of Asymmetric Flow**, a theoretical framework that studies the dynamic redistribution of exposure across multiple independent variables.

The theory proposes that the collective behavior of a multi-variable system should be analyzed as a whole rather than as isolated variables.

The **Asymmetric Flow & Geometric Absorption Algorithm** provides a mathematical implementation of this theoretical framework.

**La Pekillada** is the first reference implementation created to experimentally evaluate the theory under controlled simulations.

# 🧩 Concept

The algorithm is based on an elastic distribution system:

- Three independent variables operate simultaneously.
- The successful variable returns to minimum exposure.
- The unsuccessful variables increase their exposure progressively.
- The system studies whether accumulated exposure can be absorbed by future positive events.

The objective is to analyze the behavior of progressive allocation systems under different statistical conditions.

# ⚙️ Algorithm Logic

The model follows these rules.

## Initial State

```text
A = 1
B = 1
C = 1
```

Each variable starts with the minimum exposure unit.

---

## Event Resolution

When an event occurs:

### Winning Variable

The winning variable returns to the minimum value.

```text
Winner = 1
```

---

### Losing Variables

The losing variables increase.

```text
Loser = Loser × 2
```

Example:

```text
Initial

A = 1
B = 1
C = 1

Event

A wins

New state

A = 1
B = 2
C = 2
```

# 📊 Mathematical Model

The system studies:

- Exposure accumulation
- Capital consumption
- Geometric progression
- Variance impact
- Recovery behaviour
- Maximum risk thresholds

Main variables:

```text
R = Available Resources

E = Exposure Level

V = Variance

T = Number of Iterations
```

# 🔬 Simulation Environment

The repository works as a mathematical laboratory.

Possible experiments:

- 100 rounds
- 1,000 rounds
- 100,000 rounds
- Monte Carlo simulations

Metrics evaluated:

✅ Final balance

✅ Maximum exposure reached

✅ Maximum drawdown

✅ Recovery periods

✅ System stability

# 🛡️ Risk Analysis

This project does not claim guaranteed profitability.

The model studies the point where:

- Geometric growth exceeds available capital.
- External limits affect execution.
- Variance creates extreme scenarios.

Important factors:

- Starting capital
- Maximum allowed exposure
- Number of iterations
- External constraints

# 🧪 Experimental Validation

Validation is performed through:

## Monte Carlo Analysis

Thousands of independent simulations can be executed to measure:

- Probability distribution
- Average results
- Extreme events
- Risk of exhaustion
